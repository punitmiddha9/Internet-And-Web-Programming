    <h1 align="center">Mid Wicket - Hardik Pandya</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30pt;">This is positioned on the leg side, between square leg and mid-on. It is roughly between 45-60 degrees from the bat. It is another position where run-saving is the main aim, rather than attacking the batsmen.</p>>
