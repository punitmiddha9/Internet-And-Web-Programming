 <h1 align="center">Third Man - Shachin Tendulkar</h1>
 <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 30pt;">You will find the third man positioned behind the wicketkeeper on the off-side. The fielder is usually 45 degrees to the wicket around on the boundary. It covers a large area - anything that goes through the slip and gully area. Often Test teams don't have a third man because they prefer to attack than defend.</p>
